Formal models of games help us account for and predict behavior, leading to
more robust and innovative designs. While the games research community has 
proposed many formalisms for both the ``game half'' (game models, game
description languages) and the ``human half'' (player modeling) of a game
experience, little attention has been paid to the {\em interface} between
the two, particularly where it concerns the player expressing her intent
toward the game. We describe an analytical and computational toolbox based
on programming language theory to examine the phenomenon sitting between
control schemes and game rules, which we identify as a distinct {\em
player intent language} for each game.

\section{Introduction}

To study how players interact with games, we examine both the rules of the
underlying system and the choices made by the player. 
The field of player modeling has identified the
value in constructing models of player cognition: while a game as
a self-contained entity can allow us to learn about its mechanics and
properties as a formal system, we cannot understand the {\em dynamics} of
that system unless we also account for the human half of the equation.
Meanwhile, Crawford~\cite{crawford2003chris} identifies the necessity of
looking at the complete information loop created between a player and a
digital game, defining {\em interactivity} in games as their ability to
carry out a conversation with a player, including listening, processing,
and responding, identifying the importance of all three to the overall
experience.

Given this understanding of games-as-conversation, we should expect to
discover something like a {\em language} through which games and players converse. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:gameloop}, we illustrate the game-player loop as a
process which includes an {\em interface} constituting such a language.
The Game Ontology Project~\cite{zagal2007towards} describes game interfaces
as follows:
\begin{quote} \em
The interface is where the player and game meet, the mapping
between the embodied reactions of the player and the manipulation of game
entities. It refers to both how the player interacts with the game and how
the game communicates to the player.
\end{quote}
The first part, {\em how the player interacts with the game}, is
called the {\em input}, which is further subdivided into {\em input device}
and {\em input method}. Input devices are hardware controllers (mice,
keyboards, joysticks, etc.) and input {\em methods} start to brush the
surface of something more semantic: they include choices about {\em locus of
manipulation} (which game entities can the player control?) and direct
versus indirect action, such as selecting an action from a menu of options
(indirect) versus pressing an arrow key to move an avatar (direct).

However, any close look at interactive fiction, recent mobile games, or
rhythm games (just to name a few examples) will reveal that design choices
for input methods have much more variety and possibility than these two
dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework to support analyzing and exploring
that design space. 

Our first step is to refine input {\em methods} to input {\em languages}:
we are ultimately asking, how can a player communicate their intent, and
how does a digital game recognize this intent?  So, in linguistic terms,
the ``phonemes'' of such a language are hardware controls such as button
presses and joystick movement. Then, the syntax and semantics are defined
by each game individually, depending on what meaning they give to each
control input. This language defines the verbs of the game, which may
include moving, selecting inventory items, examining world items, applying
or using items, entering rooms, and combat actions.  (Note that such a
language is also distinct from a game's {\em mechanics}: mechanics include
system behavior which is out of the player's control, such as falling with
gravity, non-player character actions, and other autonomous behavior.) This
language is both {\em afforded} by the game designer---she must communicate
to players which verbs are available---and {\em constrained} by her---she
may declare certain expressions invalid.

\begin{figure*}

it relates to language, interface, and cognition.}
\label{fig:gameloop}
\end{figure*}

Since the constraints on what
language they may use are wholly determined by a piece of software (the
game interface), we argue that these languages more in common with a {\em
programming language}\footnote{We define PL broadly as a formal language whose meaning
is fully grounded in a computational system.} (PL) than a natural language. 
Accordingly, each game in some sense {\em defines its own programming
language}. In a slogan, we could term this project {\em games as
programming languages}.
%
Specifically, we propose \emph{player intent languages} as a
PL-inspired framework for designing player-game interfaces.

% What is to be gained by this analogy?

This analogy opens up a whole field of methodology to try applying to
games.  The PL research community has a long and deep
history of assigning mathematically formal semantics to languages and
analyzing those semantics. As games researchers become more interested in
the emergent consequences of the systems they assemble, the tools of PL
theory have a lot to offer. For example, PL theory provides an account of
{\em compositionality}, i.e. how fragments of expression fit together to
form higher-level meanings. In games, this translates into being able to
understand player {\em skills} or strategies as compositions of player
actions, which we demonstrate in this paper by using a formalized input
language as a kind of ``player AI scripting language.''

% PL theory also
% provides an account of
% how to relate meaning in a {\em low level} representation (such as assembly
% language, or on the games side, control-level interactions) to meaning in a
% {\em high-level} language (such as a language like Java or a game's state
% space), allowing us to draw abstraction boundaries and consider system
% components in compositional terms. For example, we can consider what it
% means to have a game with the same {\em internal mechanics} (or what Salen
% and Zimmerman (XXX) call {\em constiutative rules}) but distinct interface,
% comparing the meaning of these interfaces on formal terms.


% In Salen and Zimmerman (XXX cite) terms,
% PL theory can help us formalize the {\em constituative mechanics} of a
% game's interface so that we may consider distinct {\em operational rules} 
% that interface with them. 

% XXX example: parser vs. hypertext interactive fiction?
%
% Parser:
%   Interface:
%     >
%   Recognized utterances - contextual:
%    > <verb> <noun>
%    > <verb>
%    > <verb> <noun> <preposition> <noun>
%
% Hypertext:
%   Interface: contextual, e.g.
%     [[go north]] or [[go south]] or [[take sword]] ?
%   Recognized utterances:
%     (link clicks) - 1 dimensional, contextual, ambiguous


Furthermore, by considering a player's language of expression as an object
of study in its own right, we center them as a co-designer of the experience
afforded by a game. When we treat a player's interactions as not simply an
arbitrary sequence of button presses that advances and reveals the
designer's intent, but instead as its own distinct {\em voice} that a game
system must listen and respond to, we enable the player to {\em co-create}
with the system, potentially developing deeper systems understanding
and emotional investment.

In this paper, we propose \emph{player intent languages}, a
programming languages-based approach to designing player-game
interfaces as formal objects.
%
In the remainder of the paper, we tour this approach through concrete
examples.
%
Specifically, we consider a simple game design space and make points
in this space precise by introducing the components of a programming
olanguage:
%
abstract syntax (Section~\ref{sec:syntax}),
%
type system~(Section~\ref{sec:typesys}), 
%
and operational semantics~(Section~\ref{sec:opsem}).
%
For component, we give a corresponding concept in the game world.
%
By grounding these game concepts in analogous programming language
concepts, we gain powerful PL reasoning tools and design methodologies
to benefit the game design process.

We demonstrate the payoff of this line of thought by extending the
metaphor to account for \emph{play traces} as \emph{straight-line
  programs} (Section~\ref{sec:traces}), and {\em player skills} as
\emph{general programs} (e.g., programs with parameters, branching and
looping)~(Section~\ref{sec:skills}).
%
These structures give semantic logs and general strategies,
respectively, for accomplishing a task in the game world.
%
The conceptual framework of player intention languages gives rise to
further research directions, which we briefly outline and discus
before concluding (Sections~\ref{sec:discussion} and \ref{sec:conclusion}).

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose \emph{player intent languages}, a systematic framework for
applying programming language design principles to the design of
player-game interfaces.
%
We define this framework through simple examples of syntax (aka player
intents), type systems (aka contextual interfaces) and operational
semantics (aka game mechanics).
%
We show how applying this framework to a player-game interface
naturally gives rise to formal notions of play traces (as
straight-line programs) and player skills (as general programs with
branching and recursion).
%
By defining a player intent language, game design concepts become
formal objects of study, allowing existing PL methodology to inform and
guide the design process.

%
%We discuss broader implications and directions for future work, based
%on this conceptual framework.
