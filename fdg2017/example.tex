\subsection{Context Dependence}

include discussion of whether the above sequences of actions will actually
succeed or not; protocols...

include discussion of inventory menu, shops, crafting, recipes, other contextual menus
(XXX here or later?)

\subsection{Semantics}

(We can probably just describe these in prose rather than writing out the
syntax in full)

XXX define predicates like extracts, cost of crop, etc?

% apply tool depends on the tool and the thing you apply it to;
% mining yields stone, copper
% chopping tree yields wood (nondeterministic: seeds, sap, acorns, etc.)
Case $\syn{apply}\param{entity}$:\\
If the player is near an object that can be {\em extracted} with the
applied tool (e.g. a tree may be extracted by an axe; stone and ores may be
extracted by the pickaxe), compute and display a state change removing that object and
replacing it with its drops. \\
If the player is not near such an object, compute and display nothing.

XXX say something about drops being random

The game has some internal rules that will detect collisions between the
player and dropped items to add them to her inventory (these collision
rules are not part of the player language, since they occur passively).

Case $\syn{move}\param{direction}$:\\
Change the player location (XXX mention above caveat re collisions)


Case $\syn{inquire}\param{object}$:\\
XXX

crops yield money

money can buy things in stores

recipe menu

interact depends on whether a person, chest, door, other game object
